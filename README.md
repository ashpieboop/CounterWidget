# Counter Widget

A simple tally counter widget for android. Written in jetpack glance.

## Current features

- Single counter (all widget instances are synced)
- Shows the current count
- A button to increment the counter
- A button to decrement the counter
- A button to reset the counter to 0
- Responsive layouts

## Ideas

This list is a collection of things that I may or may not do in the future.

Please feel free to submit feature requests via issues or contribute with pull requests.

- Have the counter show and be controllable in the app's main activity too
- Iterate on the widget's layouts, maybe provide some alternative look and feel
- Have multiple different counters
  - Name counters
  - Give them a color
    - Optionally provide different colors for dark/light themes
- Make the widget customizable
  - Toggle reset button
  - Background transparency
  - Show/hide name
  - Switch between counter color and default background
- Publish the app on F-droid

## Technical debt log

- Need to refactor everything, this is basically a one shot and most likely has some naming and architecture issues
